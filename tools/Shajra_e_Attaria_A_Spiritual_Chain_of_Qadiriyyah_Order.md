The Qadiriyyah order of Sufism is one of the most widespread and influential orders in the Muslim world. The order is known for its emphasis on the love of Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him), and its adherence to the orthodox teachings of Islam. The order also promotes tolerance and harmony among different sects and groups of Muslims, as well as non-Muslims. The order has produced many eminent scholars, poets, saints, and leaders who have contributed to the Islamic civilization and culture.
 
The Qadiriyyah order has a distinctive method of dhikr, or remembrance of Allah, which involves chanting the names and attributes of Allah in a rhythmic manner. The dhikr is usually performed in a group, led by a spiritual master or a representative. The dhikr is meant to purify the heart from worldly attachments and distractions, and to increase one's awareness and love of Allah. The dhikr also creates a spiritual bond among the participants, who share their joys and sorrows with each other.
 
The Qadiriyyah order has many branches and sub-orders, each with its own variations and adaptations to different regions and cultures. Some of the famous branches are: the Naqshbandiyyah, the Chishtiyyah, the Suhrawardiyyah, the Shadhiliyyah, and the Rifaiyyah. The Qadiriyyah order is also known for its openness to other Sufi orders, and its respect for their teachings and practices. The Qadiriyyah order welcomes anyone who seeks to attain the spiritual knowledge and guidance of Allah.
